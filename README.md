# Vamsi Krishna's Portfolio 🚀

Yo, welcome to my digital lair where code meets chaos. This ain't your grandma's portfolio – it's a React-powered beast built with Vite, because who has time for slow builds? 😎

## Quick Setup (Don't Mess This Up)

1. Clone this bad boy:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/raptor7197/thekrishna.git
   cd thekrishna
   ```

2. Install the chaos:
   ```bash
   npm install
   # or if you're fancy (like me)
   yarn install
   ```

3. Unleash the beast:
   ```bash
   npm run dev
   # or if you are better
   yarn dev
   ```

Boom! Your browser should open to localhost:5173. If not, check your karma.

## What's Inside This Dankness?

- **React 19** – Because we live in the future
- **Vite** – Builds faster than your ex moves on
- **GSAP** – Animations smoother than butter
- **Three.js** – 3D stuff because 2D is for peasants
- **Tailwind** – Styling without the headache
- **Mobile Menu** – Hamburger that actually works (shocking, I know)

## Features That Slappp

-  Interactive world map (because why not?)
-  Mobile-friendly (or so they say)
-  Dark theme (light mode is for pussies)
-  Fast as heck (thanks Vite)
-  Bug-free (probably not, but let's pretend)

## Contributing

Found a bug? Cool, fix it yourself. PRs welcome if they're not trash.

## License

MIT – Do whatever, just don't blame me if it breaks.
